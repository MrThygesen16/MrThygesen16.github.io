<p>After many months of intending to learn the basics of webdev, here I am. If you are seeing this, then I have succeeded in my goal to create a simple static site for me to display the projects I am currently working on, or have completed in the past. </p>

<p>Furthermore, this site will also function as a simple blog. The topics I intend to write about will hopefully range from programming, to literature, music, and more. The ability to write about different topics and have it documented and published online has always been an intriguing thought. </p>

<p>If you would like to learn more about me and my interests, please take a look at the About page.</p>

<p>Quick disclaimer; I am not a webdev, nor am I a designer. The goal of the site is more function than form. I did try to make this website look at least a little presentable.</p>
