# About Me

______________________________

My name is Mike. I am an undergraduate at Macquarie University studying a Bachelor of Information Technology, majoring in Software Technology. The languages I am most proficient in are Python and Java. I have had experience with Scala, SQL, C, and Bash. I am currently learning Rust. I am most fascinated by the development and study of programming languages. Currently I am working through the book 'Programming Interpreters' and implementing it in Rust.

Outside of university and programming, I enjoy playing guitar (electric and acoustic). I am currently in the band 'Day Release', with my two brothers. We formed the band during isolation in 2019. Since then we have played dozens of gigs and released four songs. Songs include 'Summer Buzzin', 'Don't Go Hiding', and more. Our style is a good mix of our respective influences, including rock, funk, metal, and even reggae.
